### Project Title: Redox Airline Business growth Analysis

### Project Overview
The airline's management team has a strong airline
operations background, but donâ€™t have much financial or
data analytics experience. Many of their systems are
disparate and not connected. I was shocked to find out
that until just recently, the airline could not pull specific
aircraft details, such as route and seating capacity, from a
single report, but rather needed to open two or more files
and compare the information.
I have been requested by the CEO to analyze the data and
present key insights to drive the business growth and
position in the industry
