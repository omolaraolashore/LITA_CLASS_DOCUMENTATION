### Project Overview
---
The airline's management team has a strong airline
operations background, but donâ€™t have much financial or
data analytics experience. Many of their systems are
disparate and not connected. I was shocked to find out
that until just recently, the airline could not pull specific
aircraft details, such as route and seating capacity, from a
single report, but rather needed to open two or more files
and compare the information.
I have been requested by the CEO to analyze the data and
present key insights to drive the business growth and
position in the industry

### Data Sources
---
The Data for this project was provided by the Operations Department of the Airline. The Data includes the Flight Table, which has  columns describing 
    SeatCapacity,FuelCostperSeatMile,Scheduled Departure and Avg Ticket Price.
It also has the Routes table that shows coloumn with
    RouteID,Airport,AirportID	,Distance,and	ListPrice.
The Data also includes Airport Table, having columc like
    AirportID,	AirportName and	Gates (number of available).
Lastly,there is a table in the Data given called Aircraft Table,it has columns like
    AircraftID,	AircraftType,	SeatCapacity,	FuelCostperSeatMile (Cents) and	Fuel cost per mile

### Data Cleaning and preparation
---
1. **Data Cleaning**: Removed duplicates and standardized date formats.
2. **Pivot Tables**: 
3. **Visualization**: .
4. **Formulas**: Applied Excel functions such as `SUMIF`, `AVERAGE`, and `VLOOKUP` for aggregating data and extracting insights.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
---
This involves exploring the avaialable Data to answer some analytical questions such as:
  - Which is the most common type of Aircraft?

  - What is the maximum average ticket price for flights on the aircrafts?

  - What is the fuel cost per mile in Dollars

  - What is the total revenue per flight

  - Which route accounts for the lowest percentage of total revenue?
